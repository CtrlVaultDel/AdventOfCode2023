=== Format of folders ===

-   Days/
    -   Day/ (e.g. 1/)
        -   problem.txt
        -   sample.txt
        -   userName/ (e.g. rdevau/)
            -   Whatever files you need (e.g. sample.json, solution.js)

Please do your best not to use AI, but this isn't graded.

Feel free to clone this down and use it in your own repo instead of updating here if you'd prefer to do so.

Otherwise, the format will look like this:

1. New day unlocks
2. Someone will make a new branch (ex: rdevau/day1-init) get the information from the website and store it for everyone
   (ex: Day1 problem.txt & sample.txt will be updated to actually have the data)
3. Users create their own branch off of that (ex: "rdevau/day1")
4. Within the specific days folder create a folder for yourself and put whatever files you need in there
   (ex: Days/1/rdevau)
   For me I may convert the txt file into JSON and have a solution file (sample.json & solution.js)
5. Feel free to merge your code back into the project since the only thing that should be changed is your own personal folder within a given day.
6. Have fun!
